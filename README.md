# Writ-App-0.1
My ongoing project to create an easy to use and simple app to track fluctuating moods.

The primary focus is two-fold.  One, I wanted to create an app that is inoffensive and very simple for use by those with mental illness when their faculties are impaired.  Two, the past entries are unalterable, encouraging honesty and openness when showing past entries to mental health professionals.

We are currently on version 0.1 and though the app is functional, production on it is on hold until further notice.
